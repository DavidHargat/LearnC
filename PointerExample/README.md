# Pointer Example
Struggling to understand how pointers work in C?


Maybe this example will help!


Compile it and see the magic of pointers.


# Explanation of pointers.

A POINTER is an address to some memory.

In C, the symbol `*` DEREFERENCES a pointer,
this means it gets whatever memory is stored at that pointer;
therefore `*(x)` means memory at the address `x`.

In C, we also have the symbol `&`.

It's much like the opposite of `*` because
instead of getting some memory we're getting
an ADDRESS to some memory, therefore
`&(x)` means the address of `x`.
	
# Line by line explanation of main.c

Create a constant int `a` and set it to 12


`int a = 12;`

Create a POINTER `ptr`


set it to the ADDRESS of `a` (where we have `12` stored in memory)


`int *ptr = &a;`

Print out our variables.


`printf( "a    == %d \n", a);`


`printf( "ptr  == %p \n", ptr);`


Print out whats stored at `ptr`


`printf( "*ptr == %d \n", *ptr);`


Print out the address of `a`.


`printf( "&a   == %p \n", &a);`


The memory at the address `ptr` is the same as `a`!


`printf( "*ptr == a \n\n");`


### The above example shows how `ptr` is equivalent to the address of `a`. 

(redundant `printf` statements are ommitted from here)


The index `i` of `ptr` is the memory at `ptr+i`


In other words:


`ptr[i] == *(ptr+i)` 


For example:


`ptr[0] == *(ptr+0)`


`ptr[0] == *ptr`

Since `ptr[i]` is just a notation for `*(i+ptr)`


We can say: `i` of `ptr` is the same as the memory at `i+ptr`.


`i[ptr] == *(i+ptr)`


For example:


`0[ptr] == *(0+ptr)`


`0[ptr] == *ptr`

Since `*` and `&` are essentially opposites you can use them together to cancel eachother out


For example:


`*&a == a`
